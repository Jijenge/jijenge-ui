            I like computers one because they make work more easier. It has made the world to be a global market and thus made everything to work out easier. I first got interested in computers when I was in form two. They were first introduced with a man called Carlos and his wife. I was among the first to join the computer class and thus my interest rose from there.

            The project Iâ€™m happy for is the one we did at Tunapanda involving blockchain technology. We were creating a website which would enable people to register their land using blockchain. Currently I am mentoring youngstars at Mogra on how to use computers.
